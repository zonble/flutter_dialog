`flutter_dialog` is a Flutter package designed to simplify the integration of a
voice assistant into your Flutter app. It provides interfaces for ASR (Automatic
Speech Recognition), NLU (Natural Language Understanding), NLG (Natural Language
Generation), and TTS (Text-to-Speech) engines, along with a default
implementation for voice interaction.

By default:

- The ASR engine utilizes the `speech_to_text` package.
- he TTS engine employs the `flutter_tts` package.
- The NLU and NLG engines leverage Google’s Gemini API.

You can easily customize your dialog flow and substitute the default engines
with your own implementations.
